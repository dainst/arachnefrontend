/**
 *  The interesting question was, should a click on the projekt logo/name lead the user to the project page or to remove
 * the filter as the others do it. I think no body will understand why he leaves a project when he clicks, so I decided
 * to make the logo a link to the project page.
 *
 * I then spent a lot of time trying and thinking we need a "leave project / search everywhere"-button but in the end
 * why? what would the average DAU-archaelogical user do If he or she wants to search everywhere? click on the arachne
 * logo, nothing else.
