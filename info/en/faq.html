                        How to combine multiple keywords?

                    <p>
                        If you enter multiple keywords, every object that reflects the content of all keywords, will be
                        found. By default, keywords are linked with a logical AND.
                    </p>
                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=Akropolis Athen">Akropolis Athen</a></p>

                        How to exclude keywords?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        By placing a hyphen in front of a keyword, you can exclude any objects from the search result,
                        which
                        include the latter.
                    </p>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=Akropolis -Athen">Akropolis -Athen</a></p>

                        How to enter complex logical operators in a search query?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        Arachne supports the logical operators AND, OR and NOT. Pay attention to the usual operator
                        precedence:
                        NOT has priority to AND has priority to OR. You can use brackets to alter the precedence of the
                        concatenation.
                    </p>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=Herakles AND (Dionysos OR Bacchus)">Herakles AND
                        (Dionysos OR Bacchus)</a></p>

                        How to search for entire phrases instead of multiple loose words?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        Put the entered phrase between quotation marks. Hereby only objects that contain exactly this
                        phrase can be found.
                    </p>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=&quot;Akropolis von Athen&quot;">"Akropolis von
                        Athen"</a></p>

                        How to specifically search in single fields rather than searching the entire content of an
                        object?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        This can be achieved by prefixing the searched fields, separated by a colon. Following fields
                        for
                        object of all categories are currently available:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>entityId</code>: The global, unique Arachne ID of an object</li>
                        <li><code>internalId</code>: The category-specific serial number</li>
                        <li><code>type</code>: The category</li>
                        <li><code>title</code>: The title</li>
                        <li><code>subtitle</code>: The subtitle</li>
                        <li><code>datasetGroup</code>: The recordset(dataset)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=title:&quot;Akropolis von Athen&quot;">title:"Akropolis
                        von Athen"</a>,

                        <a href="search?q=subtitle:&quot;Attika&quot;">subtitle:"Attika"</a>,
                        <a href="search?q=datasetGroup:Arachne">datasetGroup:Arachne</a></p>

                    <p>For <code>type</code>, the exact German category name must be used, i.e.
                        "Topographien" and not "topographien", "Topographie" or "Topographies".
                        A more convenient way is the "show all" link on the category pages, e.g. for
                        <a href="category/?c=topographie">Topographies</a>.
                        A list of all categories is given <a href="categories">here</a>.</p>

                        Which wildcards are supported?

                    <p>
                        The search query can contain the following wildcards:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><code>?</code> as any single symbol</li>
                        <li><code>*</code> as none or multiple successive random symbols</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=Akropolis*">Akropolis*</a><br/>
                        <small>(finds next to "Akropolis" terms like "Akropolismuseum" or "Akropolisberg")</small>

                        Are regular expressions supported?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        Yes, the search engine supports all common operators to formulate regular expressions. Latter
                        must
                        be
                        placed between two slashes.
                    </p>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=/Pompe[ij]/">/Pompe[ij]/</a><br/>
                        <small>(finds results for “Pompeii” as well as for “Pompeji”)</small>
                    </p>
                </div>

                        Are exclusively objects found, that contain the exact entered keywords?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        No, the keywords are adapted to the point that similar notations can be found. For example,
                        words
                        are reduced to their respective families, so that "cow" ("Kuh") also finds "cows" ("Kühe") and
                        vice versa.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, the operator "~" allows for a rough, approximate search. That means that terms with
                        a
                        similar spelling than the specified keyword can also be found.
                    </p>

                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=Pompei~">Pompei~</a><br/>
                        <small>(finds “Pompei”, as well as “Pompeji” or “Pompeii”)</small>

                        The search query caused a syntax error, what to do?

                    <p>Syntax errors may occur if the request contains reserved search operators (eg. `/` or `~`). If
                        these
                        operators are used within a search, they can be escaped with `\` or be used as part of a search
                        phrase within `"`.</p>
                    <p class="query-example">Example: <a href="search?q=87\/243">87\/243</a>

                        What determines the order of search results?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        By default search results in Arachne are ordered by relevance. This depends on one hand on the
                        relevance of an
                        object in relation to the keywords. So objects appear earlier if they contain the keyword
                        several
                        times or in the title.
                        On the other hand, the quality of a record flows into the relevance measurement. This gives
                        highly
                        contextualized, extensively illustrated and described objects a better position in search
                        results.
                    </p>

                    <p>The default sorting can be changed right above the display of search results</p>

                        Why are there sometimes more sometimes less filters being offered?
                    </uib-accordion-heading>
                    <p>
                        There are a bunch of default filters, that are offered for any search. This includes "Location"
                        and
                        "Dating".
                        In addition there are filters that only exist in certain categories, for example "Function" in
                        the
                        category "Object".
                        Those filters are only shown, if the filter "Category" has the corresponding category selected.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In a specific search only filters that can actually help filtering the search result are shown.
                        If, for example in the search results no results are included for which a location is specified,
                        the
                        corresponding filter is not displayed.
